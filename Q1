Mid to Deep-Level Interview Questions with Answers


---

1. Statistics: Probability Distributions, CLT, Hypothesis Testing

1. Explain the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and give a practical example.

Answer: CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the original distribution's shape. For example, if we take repeated samples of average daily sales across 30 stores, their average will tend to be normally distributed.



2. Difference between t-distribution and normal distribution?

Answer: t-distribution has heavier tails and is used when sample size is small or variance is unknown. It converges to normal as sample size increases.



3. How to test if a sample follows a specific distribution?

Answer: Use goodness-of-fit tests like the Chi-square test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.



4. Binary outcome vs categorical variable - test for association?

Answer: Use Chi-square test of independence.



5. Difference between Type I and Type II errors?

Answer: Type I error: false positive (rejecting a true null), Type II error: false negative (failing to reject a false null).



6. What is a p-value?

Answer: Probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value suggests evidence against the null.



7. Z-test vs T-test assumptions?

Answer: Z-test assumes known variance and large samples; T-test assumes unknown variance and smaller sample size.



8. Variance vs shape of distribution?

Answer: Higher variance leads to wider spread; low variance leads to peaked distribution.



9. Law of Large Numbers vs CLT?

Answer: LLN says the sample mean converges to the population mean with more samples. CLT says the distribution of sample means becomes normal.



10. Biased coin experiment?

Answer: Toss the coin multiple times, record proportion of heads, and use binomial distribution or estimate confidence intervals.





---

2. Linear Regression

1. Assumptions of linear regression?

Answer: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, no multicollinearity.



2. When Ridge or Lasso?

Answer: Use Ridge when all features are useful and you want to penalize large coefficients. Use Lasso for feature selection as it can zero out coefficients.



3. No intercept scenario?

Answer: When you know the relationship passes through the origin (e.g., zero input yields zero output).



4. High R^2 but poor performance?

Answer: Likely overfitting; high training performance doesn’t generalize to test data.



5. Role of p-values?

Answer: Tests if coefficients are significantly different from zero.



6. What is multicollinearity?

Answer: When predictors are highly correlated; detect using VIF and address with regularization or removing variables.



7. MSE, RMSE, MAE?

Answer: MSE penalizes larger errors, RMSE is in the same unit as output, MAE is more robust to outliers.





---

3. Logistic Regression & Evaluation Metrics

1. Interpreting coefficients in logistic regression?

Answer: Log-odds change for a unit increase in the predictor. Exp(coef) gives odds ratio.



2. Confusion matrix metrics?

Answer: Accuracy, Precision (TP / TP+FP), Recall (TP / TP+FN), F1-score (harmonic mean).



3. ROC and AUC?

Answer: ROC plots TPR vs FPR. AUC is area under the curve; higher AUC implies better model.



4. High accuracy with imbalanced data?

Answer: Accuracy can be misleading; use Precision, Recall, or AUC.



5. Threshold tuning?

Answer: Lowering threshold increases recall, raising it increases precision. Choose based on business need.



6. Can logistic model non-linearities?

Answer: Not directly, but you can add interaction or polynomial terms.



7. Logistic regression performance low?

Answer: Try feature engineering, more expressive models (trees, ensembles), or handling imbalance.





---

4. Tree-Based Models

1. RF vs XGBoost?

Answer: RF builds trees in parallel, XGBoost sequentially boosts trees. XGBoost usually performs better but is more complex.



2. Hyperparameters in RF?

Answer: max_depth controls tree size, n_estimators controls number of trees, min_samples_split controls node splits.



3. Learning rate in boosting?

Answer: Controls contribution of each tree. Low values need more trees but prevent overfitting.



4. Feature importance metrics?

Answer: Gini and entropy both split data; Gini is faster, entropy more informative.



5. Preventing overfitting in trees?

Answer: Limit depth, use pruning, minimum samples per leaf, or regularization.



6. Bagging vs Boosting?

Answer: Bagging averages many independent models (RF), boosting corrects previous errors iteratively (XGBoost).



7. XGBoost and missing values?

Answer: XGBoost learns the best direction to handle missing values in splits.





---

5. EDA, Feature Engineering

1. Detecting outliers?

Answer: Z-score, IQR method, visual plots (boxplot), isolation forest.



2. Imputing missing values?

Answer: Mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical, KNN or model-based imputation.



3. Label vs One-Hot Encoding?

Answer: Label for ordinal data; One-hot for nominal variables.



4. Handling skewed features?

Answer: Log, square-root, or Box-Cox transformations.



5. Visualizing correlation?

Answer: Correlation matrix heatmap, pairplots.



6. Feature selection methods?

Answer: Filter (corr, chi2), wrapper (RFE), embedded (Lasso, tree importances).



7. Scaling in trees vs linear models?

Answer: Tree-based models don’t require scaling; linear models do.





---

6. Neural Networks

1. Forward/backward propagation?

Answer: Forward: input to output; backward: gradients via chain rule to update weights.



2. ReLU vs sigmoid/tanh?

Answer: ReLU avoids vanishing gradients and is faster to compute.



3. Vanishing gradient problem?

Answer: Gradients shrink in deep networks, stalling learning. Mitigate via ReLU, BatchNorm.



4. Batch size and learning rate?

Answer: Large batch = stable but slow; small batch = noisy but faster. LR affects step size.



5. What is dropout?

Answer: Randomly drops units to prevent co-adaptation and overfitting.



6. Choosing hidden layers/units?

Answer: Trial and error, cross-validation, or heuristics (e.g., input + output nodes / 2).



7. Weight initialization?

Answer: Xavier or He initialization help maintain gradient flow.





---

7. Python Programming

1. Shallow vs Deep Copy?

Answer: Shallow copies reference inner objects; deep copies clone everything.



2. List comprehension vs map/filter?

Answer: List comprehensions are more readable; map/filter are functional.



3. is vs ==?

Answer: is compares identity, == compares values.



4. Memory inefficiency in Pandas?

Answer: Use category dtype, drop unused columns, use df.astype().



5. Decorators?

Answer: Functions that modify other functions. Example: logging, access control.



6. Generators?

Answer: Yield values lazily, saving memory (e.g., reading large files).



7. Mutable default arguments?

Answer: Can lead to bugs due to shared state. Use None and initialize inside.





---

8. LLMs / Agent AI

1. Language model vs Agent?

Answer: LM generates text; agent can act in an environment using tools, memory.



2. Transformers vs RNNs?

Answer: Transformers use attention, faster to train, better for long sequences.



3. Prompt engineering?

Answer: Crafting inputs to guide model behavior effectively.



4. Limitations of LLMs?

Answer: Hallucination, context window, biases, lack of real reasoning.



5. RAG models?

Answer: Combine LLMs with retrieval (e.g., search index) to ground outputs.



6. Fine-tuning LLMs?

Answer: Adjust model weights on domain-specific data.



7. Safety and bias concerns?

Answer: Mitigate with RLHF, content filtering, fairness audits.
